# TodaysDinner

This is a recipe app which helps users with daily dinner recipes with whatever ingredients they have in the fridge. I built this application from scratch .Some of the things I used while building this app are

* Intents.

* Recycler Views.

* Recipe Puppy API.

* Picasso.

* Web Views.

* Constraint Layout.



# Challenges
  
  * This was my first time working with the third party API's. I had to do a bit of reasearch for using it.
  
  * I also used Picasso for the first time while making this app.
  

## Features

  * User can see all the names of Recipes which they can make.
  
  * User can access the full recipes by clicking on recipe name.
